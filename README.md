# Pre-work - *Memory Game*

**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: Ian Rogelio Flores

Time spent: 4 hours spent in total

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [✓] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [✓] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [✓] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [✓] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [✓] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [✓] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [✓] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

I did not use any outside resources

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it?
A challenge I encountered while creating this submission was that at some point in the process, I had mistyped the name of the stop button and when trying to make sure that clicking the start button would hide it and make available the stop button, I found it wasn’t working properly, after some minutes thinking what might be causing the error, I looked through the code that involved the buttons themselves and the hidden class. At first, I almost missed it but after a second quick read I found I had misspelled button and had written it in Spanish unintentionally and as it didn’t coincide with the other part of the code involving it, it did not work.
After naming it correctly it all worked which was a great relief, although I’m interested in learning more about these new coding languages, I don’t know if I could’ve fixed it as quickly had it not been a simple mistype case.


3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission?
I’d like to know how it all works in a deeper way, it might be too broad of an answer but it really has intrigued me, I had zero experience working with web development so far and having a try at it and being able to create this little game has made me realize it might not be as impossible as I thought it would be. 
I am definitely interested in how people manage to make websites that have such a seamless and smooth flow to them, we’ve all encountered that website of a big clothing store that has a wonky feel. The main question that pops to my head is how can we create a website that makes the user feel as if traveling through it for the first time just comes as second nature, how can we make a website that is both useful and aesthetically pleasing?


4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific.
Besides the optional features, given more time I would’ve liked to make it so that every time you played the game the tone each key played was randomized or changed in one way or another, for the pattern that it would play too, it would be fun to be able to code into it parts of popular songs.
An essential feature where this game to be played by a wide range of users would be to ask the user if they are colorblind and if so, the color set would change to something that is easily distinguished by everyone.
Another feature I thought about was making it so that the user had to click the buttons within a specific time frame so it heightened the stakes of the game, maybe even keep a scoreboard and ask the user for a nick so they can keep track of how many tunes they’ve memorized or if they’re playing in a group.
